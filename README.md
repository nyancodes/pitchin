# PitchIn 

An online crowdfunding app. A virtual piggy bank for groups/individuals to collectively contribute. 

Growing up an immigrant with a hobby in electronics was hard, especially when I didn't want to bother my hard-working parents. 

I was fortunate enough to have friends/family that would provide a specific budget for a gift. This idea of Pitchin came about when I wanted to combine everyone's contributions into a virtual piggy bank.
